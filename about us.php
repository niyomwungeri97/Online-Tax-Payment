                <h2>APPLICATION IDEA</h2>
                <p>We seen that Rwandan citizens fall in punishment due to the delay
                    of tax paying.<br><br>
                And we approached some people and told us that this obstacle depends
            on long lines at the tax payment service giver office, therefore we provided
        yu with an easy way of paying.<br><br>
    You can pay not depending to the location also you pay at any time. You know 
now no  need to make lines in order to save your time. </p>
